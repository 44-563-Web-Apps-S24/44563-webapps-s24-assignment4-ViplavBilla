        <h1>Viplav does chekov tonight</h1>
        <h4>THE BEAR BY ANTON CHEKOV</h4>
        <p><H3>LUKA.</h3> It isn't right, madam.... You're just destroying yourself. The
            maid and the cook have gone off fruit picking, every living being is
            rejoicing, even the cat understands how to enjoy herself and walks about
            in the yard, catching midges; only you sit in this room all day, as if
            this was a convent, and don't take any pleasure. Yes, really! I reckon
            it's a whole year that you haven't left the house!
        </p>
        <p><h3>POPOVA.</h3> I shall never go out.... Why should I? My life is already at an
            end. He is in his grave, and I have buried myself between four walls....
            We are both dead.
        </p>
        <p><h3>LUKA.</h3> Well, there you are! Nicolai Mihailovitch is dead, well, it's the
            will of God, and may his soul rest in peace.... You've mourned him--and
            quite right. But you can't go on weeping and wearing mourning for ever.
            My old woman died too, when her time came. Well? I grieved over her, I
            wept for a month, and that's enough for her, but if I've got to weep
            for a whole age, well, the old woman isn't worth it. <p>[Sighs] </p> You've
            forgotten all your neighbours. You don't go anywhere, and you see
            nobody. We live, so to speak, like spiders, and never see the light.
            The mice have eaten my livery. It isn't as if there were no good people
            around, for the district's full of them. There's a regiment quartered at
            Riblov, and the officers are such beauties--you can never gaze your fill
            at them. And, every Friday, there's a ball at the camp, and every day
            the soldier's band plays.... Eh, my lady! You're young and beautiful,
            with roses in your cheek--if you only took a little pleasure. Beauty
            won't last long, you know. In ten years' time you'll want to be a
            pea-hen yourself among the officers, but they won't look at you, it will
            be too late.
        </p>
        <p><h3>POPOVA. </h3> <p>[With determination] </p> I must ask you never to talk to me about
            it! You know that when Nicolai Mihailovitch died, life lost all its
            meaning for me. I vowed never to the end of my days to cease to wear
            mourning, or to see the light.... You hear? Let his ghost see how well I
            love him.... Yes, I know it's no secret to you that he was often unfair
            to me, cruel, and... and even unfaithful, but I shall be true till
            death, and show him how I can love. There, beyond the grave, he will see
            me as I was before his death....</p>
        <p><h3>LUKA. </h3> Instead of talking like that you ought to go and have a walk in
            the garden, or else order Toby or Giant to be harnessed, and then drive
            out to see some of the neighbours.</p>
        <p><h3>POPOVA. </h3> Oh! <p> [Weeps.] </p></p>
        <p>
            <h3>LUKA. </h3> Madam! Dear madam! What is it? Bless you!
